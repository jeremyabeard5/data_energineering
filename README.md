## Electric Vehicle Charging Station Usage Analysis in Colorado

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the utilization of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Colorado to uncover trends, usage patterns, and potential areas needing infrastructure improvements. Through this analysis, we hope to provide actionable insights that could help in planning more efficient, widespread EV charging networks across the state.

## Objectives
- To map all existing EV charging stations in Colorado.
- To analyze usage patterns across different stations and identify high traffic and underutilized locations.
- To predict future usage and infrastructure needs based on current trends.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage and complex querying.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling.
- **Django**: For creating the backend.
- **React**: For developing the interactive frontend.
