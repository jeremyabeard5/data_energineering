## Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment: A Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the placement of charging networks and their fleet of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) across the United States. It aims to uncover trends, installation patterns, and potential areas needing infrastructure improvements. Through this analysis, I hope to provide actionable insights that could help in planning more efficient, widespread EV charging networks across the country.

## Objectives
- To map all existing EV charging stations.
- To analyze installation patterns across different stations and identify high density and underutilized locations. (Population data?)
- To predict future usage and infrastructure needs based on current trends.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage and complex querying.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling.
- **Django**: For creating the backend.
- **React**: For developing the interactive frontend.
- **Tableau**: For telling stories and driving engagement.
